All apps submitted to Apple have to go tthrough a review process.
This can take between 5-10 days please allow this in your schedules.
You can check current reviw time trends here: 
[Current App review times](http://appreviewtimes.com/)

The app size limit is currently 4GB but do bear in mind users download connections.
The iTunes Store also accepts expansion files besides the app executable itself.
Antenna doenst support expansion files fo iTunes at this point.

For an app to be downloaded over a cell network and not wifi it needs to be under 100MB - this is an Apple applied cap.

Any resubmission can effectively restart this process.

You will need to have the following to submit:  

 - A correctly certificated and pacakaged app
 - Access to iTunes Connect
 - AppLoader Application
 - All assets at required resolutions
 - App MetaData

For Kids apps you will need to select a sub section for age and will also need a privacy policy to be able to submit.
If your kids app includes web links or social media links and is in teh kids category you will also need to include a parental gate:  
[Parental Gate Guide](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/parental-gates/)  

To upload your app file to iTunesConnect you can use X-code > Open Developer Tool Menu >App Loader or currently we suggest using the stand alone AppLoader version (whilst this is still supported).

AppLoader can be found here:
[Apploader Download](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/apploader/ApplicationLoader_3.0.dmg)  
AppLoader documentation here:
[AppLoader documentation](http://help.apple.com/itc/apploader/)

Simply open it and select your app from the dropdown and then select the .ipa commercial build of your app for upload. 
When finished go back to iTunesConnect and select the uploaded build under the "prepare for submission" tab.
When your happy with all the details subt your app for review.

Uou have the option to add an expansion files to the APK. The file can be up to 2GB.

You will need to have the following to submit:

- A correctly certificated and pacakaged app
- Access to the Google Play Developer area
- All assets at required resolutions
- App MetaData
- An app expansion file

Contact [Jenya Abakumov](mailto:jabakumov@antennainternational.com) to be added to these accounts.

**Expansion files upload process**

When submitting to the play store, you need to upload your expansion files after uploading the apk. Currently Google Play doesn't allow submitting an expansion file with the first versino of your app. When submitting a new app with expansion files, you must submit an app with build version 1 without an expansion file and then another one with build version 2 along with the expansion file.
