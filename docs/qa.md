Sprint implementations of QA:

By implementing Agile methodologies we adhere to test driven development principles.
Releasing in pre defined sprints we are then able to iterate and collaborate with key stakeholders to ensure a working model and user satisfaction.

Our backlog for a project is tracked and organised in Jira.

##Jira Issue Tracking


Issue/Bug Tracking:

Issues/bugs are entered into the Jira projects backlog, where they are prioritised and expedited and moved to current or future sprints as required.

Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial

Issues are assigned a severity level based on their impact to the project and their need for resolution.

All issues then pass through our internal stages of development and checking before they are agreed as done by the Project Manager or defined Stakeholders.

To Do Blocked In Progress Resolved QA Done

Items are moved into resolved normally after “brief” smoke testing by ID/CD, most items will then need proper QA testing but either stage can move to Done depending on the size/seriousness of the issue. If there is an issue with the fix, the issue is defined/commented and moved back into In Progress and reassigned.
