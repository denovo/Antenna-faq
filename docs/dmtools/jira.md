## What kind of information do I need to put in a Jira ticket?

##Jira Issue Tracking

Issues should be bug tracked through Jira - this allows multiple people to pick up an issue and allows for the correct tracking of work and resolution control. It also acts as a repository of knowledge for future issues.


Issue/Bug Tracking:

Issues/bugs are entered into the Jira projects backlog, where they are prioritised and expedited and moved to current or future sprints as required.

>Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial

Issues are assigned a severity level based on their impact to the project and their need for resolution.

All issues then pass through our internal stages of development and checking before they are agreed as done by the Project Manager or defined Stakeholders.

>To Do	 Blocked	 In Progress	 QA		 Done

Items are moved into QA normally after “brief” smoke testing by ID/CD, issuess will then need proper QA testing but either stage can move to Done depending on the size/seriousness of the issue. If there is an issue with the fix, the issue is defined/commented and moved back into In Progress and reassigned.

To aid with visualisation and management a Kanban Board can be made of the projects issues.
