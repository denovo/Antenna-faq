Simply Copy this folder to your computer then take the ‘Control’ and ‘Media’ folders from your XPC image file and add it to the ‘tour’ folder

It should look something like this (amount of media folders and numbers will vary in projects)

After creating the XP build, paste Media and Control into the 'tour' folder (as in the XP2 instructions)
Open the CONTROL folder – you’ll see files with a 4 digit number. Take a note of the number. 
Open the PARAMS folder
Open the APID.txt document. It has a 4 digit number in it. Change this number to the number from the CONTROL folder and save.
Drag everything onto the XP2
