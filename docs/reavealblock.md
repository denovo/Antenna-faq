Reveal Block: New functionality in V5

What is a reveal block?
A slide out sidebar. The Reveal Layout allows 2 blocks/layers to be on top of each other. The Top block can be shifted left or right to reveal the Bottom blockâ€™s content. One layer reveals itself from underneath or above the other. This allows for a navigation menu to be hidden under content. This is the current standard method of navigation in most apps.

We have used a reveal before in Opera Garnier but not using this new native ES functionality. The reveal block is a feature in Publisher 5 that was presented to us by Eachscape this fall. 

Examples of Reveal Blocks
Yahoo Weather, Gmail, Youtube, AirBnB currently implement the reveal block among many others.

NYPL Case Study
The New York Public Library hired us to create a Multimedia App on the Iris 2 with the intention that it would be a trial for them. During our initial meetings with them they expressed a desire for their users to be able to view the main menu and content options while remaining engaged in the current playing content.

In order to jump around the tour with ease, we created a functionality to exit content midstream. There is a tap action that sits over the top of the whole page that would trigger the reveal. Content continued to play while the menu was revealed.  The user could select another area of navigation and exit the current stop with ease.


We decided that this would be a great opportunity to try out the reveal block as an alternate means of navigation, eliminating the need for a dedicated stop list.  
Advantages
Elimnates the need for a Main Menu, dedicated Stop List Page or a Nav Bar.
Android / IOS compatible
Saves valuable real estate eliminating a bottom nav bar

Roadblocks
Only Left to Right functionality
Stability -  There is alot of customization that needs to be created in order to prevent a tap through problem.

Suggestions


While there were plenty of obstacles along the way, we believe the rewards of using this block are many and well worth the investment.
